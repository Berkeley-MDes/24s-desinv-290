# Welcome to the Creative Machine Learning Innovation Lab

This is a resource realted to ARCH 229 / DESINV 290 - a course offered at UC Berkeley in the Spring of 2024. In this project-based “innovation lab”, students learn to work with machine-learning based generative systems as a design material, and in the service of creating ML-based creativity support tools.

You're probably looking [for our class Wiki](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24s-desinv-290/wiki), which is accessible in the toolbar above (between "Projects" and "Security")
